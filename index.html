        <h2>Launch of 16 Days of Gender Activism in Migori County</h2>
        <p>
            This year, Nurture Green Africa Foundation (NGAF) was honored to participate in the launch of the 
            <strong>16 Days of Gender Activism</strong> in Migori County. Held at Migori Primary School, 
            the event brought together government officials, civil society, and local communities, united under the global campaign to end gender-based violence (GBV).
        </p>

        <h3>Why This Campaign Matters</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>16 Days of Gender Activism</strong> runs from November 25 to December 10 each year, advocating for the elimination of violence against women and girls. 
            In Migori County, this event addressed local challenges, emphasizing inclusivity, equality, and environmental consciousness.
        </p>

        <h3>NGAF‚Äôs Role & Impact</h3>
        <p>
            NGAF contributed by highlighting the link between **environmental sustainability** and **women‚Äôs empowerment**. 
            Women are often at the forefront of climate action, and addressing gender-based violence enables them to lead more effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Engaging Young Voices</h3>
        <p>
            Students from Migori Primary School actively participated, presenting creative works that called for an end to violence. 
            By fostering youth engagement, NGAF empowers the next generation to be gender equality advocates.
        </p>

        <h3>Partnerships & Call to Action</h3>
        <p>
            NGAF collaborated with local government, civil society, and community leaders to push for stronger policies, 
            better awareness, and survivor support structures. Ending GBV requires a **collective, sustained effort**.
