        <h2>PERSONAL LIFE JOURNEY</h2>
        <p>Hellow,this is Baraza Kennedy, i am a passionate learner,leader and technology enthusiast with a deep love of programming and coding.my journey began at Waliera primary school,where i excelled in my KCPE exams and continued with my education at NDENGA HIGH,here i joined in 2019.</p>
        <p>During my time i served as the deputy headboy while in form two this was just a year later after joining the school.At this point i discovered my leadership potential and aimed higher, i later become the school headboy afer a thorough campaign [prezo, haha] at that time i was just a form three student.Here is were i build my confidence and learned more about leadership and made me to be whom iam.<br>It was still in highschool were i discored my love for computer studies,it wasn't an easy task to handle education and leadeship at the same time but the dedication that i had made me to excell in both.I later scored an A- in computer at the KCSE level</br> </p>
        <p>One year later i joined the univesity of Nairobi to study Bachelor of Arts,but since my interest and passion was still in computer i was forced to transfer to Tom mboya University since i didn't qualify to take computer at the university of Nairobi.Life at Tom Mboya had taken another route,it forced me to take computer as an educational subject.<br>Here i came to realize my potential in programming and the love i have for coding despite persuing computer as an educational subject</br></p>
        <p>At Tom Mboya i met Brian, a brilliant computer guru and the CEO of 1360 an innovative app that helps students track their academic progress and communication.Brian's guidance and achievement inspired me to dive deeper into the world of coding, futher fueling my passion and ambitions in technology.</p>
        <p>I owe my determination and values to my supportive parents who have always encouraged me to dream big.</p>
