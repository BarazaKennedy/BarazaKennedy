      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Baraza kenedy a very pasionate softwaere developer and engineer.<br>
       i am a pasionate software developer and an android developer.My pasion about<br>
        computers has been a long and un identified since my childhood.It came to identification<br>
        when i was elected as a class secretary in std6,this is when i was to take care of computer laboratory,<br>
        each time i would go and just see how others are using it and even try consulting to the attendant how they are mad but just made fun.
      </p><p>This curosity never ended until i joint high school at NDENGA HIGH,at this point leadership became my thing and part of my life<br>
        I was later elected as the school deputy president when i was a form two stident and at the same time a very determined computer student<br>
        designing software and development now was the idear to build on.Luckily i was latter elected as the schol president<br>
        this gave me enough time to interact with the computers an learn more about them,<br>
        But somehow luck wasn't on my side as the leadership work overcame my pasion on software development.
      </p><p>4years later after highschool i joined University of Nairobi and later transferd to Tom Mboya university after one year.<br>
        Here is when i now met my mentor and 'Goddes'if i may say so.This was non other than Eng.BRIAN ODHIAMBO.<br>
        My mission and vission now had risen again.am now aspiring to become one of the best developer and software engineer.
